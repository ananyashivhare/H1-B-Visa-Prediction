Pre-processed the data by applying one hot encoding and explored the dataset by visualizing the data 
Implemented Decision tree, Logistic regression, Artificial neural network, Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classifier using Python to predict H1-B acceptance status based on significant features 
Concluded that Random Forest Classifier fit the dataset perfectly with an accuracy of 70%
